  This website allows users to create their own account and sign in using the required email id and password. If the required details are missing, the user won't be able to login into the website. Without the users signed in, the user would not be able to purchase a product from the website.
- ### Home page
  The landing page is the most important page of any ecommerce website. It helps the user navigate through all the trending offers and gift coupons to purchase products at discounted rates. Also there is relevant information regarding all the variety of products available in each and every sub-section.
- ### Product page
  The product pages provide the list of products belonging to a certain category. Furthermore, the products can be filtered and sorted according to the user preferences. The user can directly add the desired product in the cart and continue to shop more products.
- ### Cart page
  After the user ends up choosing all the desired products to purchase, the user gets directed to the cart page where there is a list of all the products the user would purchase and in what quantity. The total price also gets displayed in the UI underneath all the products. From there, the user can proceed to payment.
